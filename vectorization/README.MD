# Vectorization System Read Me

This repository contains code for a vectorization system that utilizes the Pipedream tool for orchestration. Below, you'll find essential information to get started with deploying and using this system.

## Introduction

Vectorization is a process of converting data into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. This repository implements a vectorization system, and Pipedream, a workflow automation platform, is used to orchestrate the code execution seamlessly.

## Orchestration with Pipedream

[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) is a powerful tool for orchestrating workflows, integrating APIs, and automating tasks. In this project, Pipedream is used to streamline the execution of various components of the vectorization system.

To integrate with Pipedream:

1. Sign up for an account on [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) if you haven't already.
2. Create a new workflow.
3. Utilize the HTTP trigger to receive requests.
4. Set up actions to execute the necessary code components.
5. Configure the workflow to interact with external services as required.
6. Deploy the workflow and obtain the endpoint URL for integration with the vectorization system.
