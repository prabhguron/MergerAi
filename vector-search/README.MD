# Vector Search Read Me

This repository contains code for a vector search system that utilizes the Pipedream tool for orchestration. Below, you'll find essential information to get started with deploying and using this system.

## Introduction

Vector search is a powerful technique for retrieving similar items based on their mathematical representations in a high-dimensional space. This repository implements a vector search system, and Pipedream, a workflow automation platform, is used to orchestrate the code execution seamlessly.

## Getting Started

To set up the vector search system:


## Orchestration with Pipedream

[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) is a powerful tool for orchestrating workflows, integrating APIs, and automating tasks. In this project, Pipedream is used to streamline the execution of various components of the vector search system.

To integrate with Pipedream:

1. Sign up for an account on [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) if you haven't already.
2. Create a new workflow.
3. Utilize the HTTP trigger to receive requests.
4. Set up actions to execute the necessary code components.
5. Configure the workflow to interact with external services as required.
6. Deploy the workflow and obtain the endpoint URL for integration with the vector search system.
